Dear Loan Support,

I recently made a payment towards my loan, and I want to ensure that the entire amount is applied directly to the principal balance. Please confirm that no portion of this payment is allocated to interest or any fees.

Loan Account Number: 1234567890
Payment Amount: $5,000

Kindly confirm once the allocation is complete.

Best regards,  
John Doe
