Hello,

I made a recent payment on my loan and would like to confirm that it has been fully applied to reduce the outstanding principal. Please ensure that none of it is used for interest or additional charges.

Loan ID: 1234567890  
Paid Amount: $5,000  

Please update me once this is processed.

Thanks,  
Jane Smith
