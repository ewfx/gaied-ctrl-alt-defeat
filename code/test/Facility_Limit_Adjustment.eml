Hello Banking Team,

As part of our ongoing financial restructuring, we would like to request a mo=
dification to the limit of our existing credit facility. Given the changes in=
 our business operations, the current limit no longer aligns with our strateg=
ic requirements.

Kindly outline the steps needed for this revision, including any supporting d=
ocumentation required. Additionally, let us know if there are any amendment f=
ees applicable to this request.

We look forward to your guidance on this matter.

Sincerely, =20
Head of Treasury Operations
