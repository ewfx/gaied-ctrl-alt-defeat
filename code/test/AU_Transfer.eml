Dear Banking Support,

We are submitting a request for the transfer of an Authorization Unit (AU) li=
nked to our corporate accounts. Due to an internal restructuring, it is criti=
cal that this AU is reassigned to the appropriate operational branch.

Could you confirm the procedural requirements, necessary documentation, and e=
stimated processing timeline? Additionally, if there are any administrative o=
r processing fees, please provide a detailed breakdown.

We appreciate your prompt response, as this is time-sensitive.

Best regards, =20
Senior Financial Officer
