Dear Banking Support Team,

We are writing to request an immediate recall of a payment that was erroneous=

iary.

Please advise on the feasibility of recalling the funds, the timeline for res=
olution, and any applicable service charges. If additional authorization is r=
equired, do let us know so we can expedite the process.

This matter is of high urgency, and we appreciate your swift action.

Best regards, =20
Corporate Accounts Team
